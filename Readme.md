# Palindrome

## General info
A palindrome is a string where it's reversed order is exactly the same as the original. This app tests if the input is a palindrome by taking the original string, running a for loop to reverse each character. And then it goes through a If/else to test if there is a match.

## Technologies

## Challenges Faced
Overall, this was a fun little app to build. The only problem I had was dealing with the capitalizations of words. This was easily solved using the `.toLowerCase()` method.

## Launch
